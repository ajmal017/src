This is a selection of my library of small tools for development, most of 
them are currently unfinshed pieces of work but I have some aims for projects to complete
throughout 2019.

##Projects
1. Mutual fund/ETF key performance statistics (by year) - analyse a dataframe consistsing
financial close price data for different stocks. Produce table of annualised performance for 
input dates and also for yearly performance.

2. Daily stock performance data - comparisons for prices with 1M, 3M, 6M and 12M to give total
return.
