# Introduction

*This is a small selection of small (mainly) **unfinshed** projects that I'll be working on in 2019.*

## Projects
1. FundAnalysis.py: 
 - Mutual fund/ETF key performance statistics (by year) - analyse a dataframe consisting
financial close price data for different stocks. Produce table of annualised performance for 
input dates and also for yearly performance.
 - Daily stock performance data - comparisons for prices with 1M, 3M, 6M and 12M to give total
return.

2. Efficient Frontier.py
- Input data for a portfolio of stocks, and performance measures (annualised return, volatility, Sharpe
Ratio) are calculated, and then random portfolio allocation is simulated, and optimal portfolios
chosen for highest Sharpe Ratio and lowest volatility.

(3. Machine learning & insights project, preferably in the consumer goods space)
