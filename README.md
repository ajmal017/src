# Introduction

*This is a selection of my library of small tools for development, most of 
them are currently **unfinshed** pieces of work but I have some aims for projects to complete
throughout 2019.*

## Projects
1. FundAnalysis.py: 
 - Mutual fund/ETF key performance statistics (by year) - analyse a dataframe consisting
financial close price data for different stocks. Produce table of annualised performance for 
input dates and also for yearly performance.

 - Daily stock performance data - comparisons for prices with 1M, 3M, 6M and 12M to give total
return.

2. CleaningUpFilesByExtension.py: Organise files by extension and move to a folder. Currently working
for both Excel (xlsx) files, and Photos (.jpg) files

3. passwordGenerator.py: Program to generate a password consisting of alphanumeric characters of a
